            <p> Khasakkinte Ithihasam (The Legends of Khasak) penned by OV Vijayan is undoubtedly one of the best and
                most read novels in Kerala and beyond. This celebrated work uniquely blends the umpteen stories of
                Thasraak, a remote village in Palakkad where the author had spent a significant time. <br> Vijayan
                juxtaposed myriad human experiences of bliss, fantasy, melancholy, poverty, disease, and death in
                lyrical prose, without pontification or grandstanding—the reason why Khasak is still an epic in literary
                history. Khasak’s multilayered reality is also deeply philosophical - an imagery that provides unique
                perspectives into religion, language, politics, and sex through its fascinating character sketches,
                almost all of them drawn from the real-life characters that the author had met in Thasraak. <span
                        class="o-section__inset"><img src="./images/khasak-1.jpg" alt="" width="400px"/></span><br>
                Deepan Sivaraman, the very talented theatre director, has risen up to the task of creating a visual
                experience based on this most challenging work and has created a play based on his reading of Khasak.
                Deepan is a noted personality in the Indian theatre space and is a winner of many awards including
                Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy Award and Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Award. <br> Portraying Khasak
                into its multidimensional plurality has been a challenge to any medium, to which this theatrical
                interpretation stands as an exception.<br> Blue Ocean Theatre and NECAB, in collaboration with several
                cultural organizations, bring this enchanting experience to Bangalore on the 6th, 7th and 8th of May
                2016, at Christ School (ICSE) Ground, Behind Christ University, Koramangala, Bengaluru. </p>

            <h3 class="o-section__title">The Drama</h3>
            <p>This play is a bold and independent adaptation of the famous Malayalam novel Khasakkinte Ithihasam (The
                Legends of Khasak) by O.V.Vijayan, which acquired the stature of latter-day mythology. The play
                recreates the imaginary rustic abode of the legendary land Khasak in the background of north Malabar's
                village shrines where myths and fantasy still merge together to form the still living traditions of
                yore. <br>

          </span>
                <br>

                The theater is setup in an open-air arena on a large rectangular pit of loose earth with extensive use
                of fire, soil, water, scent, sky , symbolic use of huge puppets and masks with real feel that allow
                audience to participate and experience the pleasures and tragedies that engulf in "Khasak". The vibrant
                scenographic experiences of this play bring back ancestors from the legend of Khasak with their
                community atmosphere in a ritualistic and philosophical plane to tell their tales of celebration of
                life, earth and myths. The director also perfectly knits the dramatic elements of Theyyam - an ancient
                ritual art form of worship from North Kerala -into this production.

                <p>This celebrated work mesmerised the literary enthusiasts by transforming a normal rural story into a
                    magical legendary multi-layered reading experience. The novel changed the space – time imaginations
                    by its profound poetics, knitting of reality and myth, sarcasm, union of carnal desire and
                    existential torment, narrative brilliance, blending of the provincial vocabulary to the body the
                    novel and sublime weaving of sex, guilt and penance. <br> The novelty of the style and content in
                    Khasak altered the history of Malayalam literature forever and redefined the literary sensibilities
                    of the average Malayalam reader. Khasak walked the unconventional path of taking the reader through
                    a fascinating history and the existential crises of a people through the experiences of its
                    protagonist, Ravi and the legends that surround the rural hamlet.<br> The stories that Khasak weaves
                    together using the encounter of the spiritual with the scientific and the myths and superstitions
                    that form the history and the reality of the mystic village make it an experience that you want to
                    go through over and over again.
